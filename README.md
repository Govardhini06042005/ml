# Machine Learning Mini Project

Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing Adaptive Boost Regression and Multiple Linear Regression to analyze and predict data trends. It utilizes machine learning techniques to build predictive models and evaluate their performance.

Features

Implements Adaptive Boost Regression and Multiple Linear Regression.

Uses Decision Trees, AdaBoost, and Support Vector Regression (SVR).

Evaluates models using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cross-Validation.

Visualizes results using Matplotlib.

Installation

Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries:

pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib numpy

Usage

Load the dataset.

Preprocess the data and split it into training and testing sets.

Train models using different regression techniques.

Evaluate model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Visualize the results.

Dataset

The dataset used contains multiple features for regression analysis.

Ensure the dataset is in CSV format and properly preprocessed before running the notebook.

Running the Notebook

Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially:

jupyter notebook ml_minipro.ipynb

Results

Comparison of regression models.

Performance evaluation using error metrics.

Model tuning using GridSearchCV for optimal performance.
